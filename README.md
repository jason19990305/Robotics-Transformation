**Title: 3D Line Representation of Two-Frame Mapping using OpenCV Trackbar and Matplotlib**

**Description:**

This repository contains a Python program that visually represents the mapping between two frames using transformation matrices. The program leverages OpenCV's Trackbar for interactive adjustments and Matplotlib for 3D line visualization.

**Key Features:**

1. **Transformation Matrices:** The core of the program involves two transformation matrices that map points from one frame to another.

2. **OpenCV Trackbar:** Users can dynamically adjust transformation parameters using the OpenCV Trackbar interface, providing an interactive way to explore the mapping.

3. **Matplotlib 3D Line:** The results of the frame mapping are displayed in a 3D line plot using Matplotlib, offering a clear and intuitive representation of the transformation.

**Usage:**

- Run the program and use the OpenCV Trackbar to modify transformation parameters.
- The Matplotlib window will dynamically update, showing the 3D line representation of the mapped points.

**Dependencies:**

- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

**How to Run:**

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the Python script.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific use case. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
